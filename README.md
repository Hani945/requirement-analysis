# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository provides a detailed overview of Requirement Analysis in software development. It explains the concept, its importance, key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, using a booking management system as an example.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that the software meets user expectations and functions correctly. This step is crucial in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it:

- Minimizes errors and misunderstandings in later stages
- Helps prioritize features and functionalities
- Serves as a reference for developers and testers

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical for several reasons:

1. **Clarity of Objectives**  
   Helps stakeholders and developers clearly understand what the system should achieve.

2. **Reduces Development Costs**  
   Identifying requirements early prevents costly changes during later stages of development.

3. **Improves Quality and User Satisfaction**  
   Ensures the final product meets user needs and expectations.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Key activities include:

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observations.  
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Understanding the underlying needs and goals of stakeholders.  
- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating clear and structured documents that describe the requirements.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Breaking down requirements, identifying relationships, and creating models such as UML diagrams.  
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring that the requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe the systemâ€™s behavior and what it should do.  
**Example (Booking Management System):**  
- Users can search for available rooms by date and location.  
- Users can book a room and receive a confirmation email.  
- Admin can manage listings and pricing.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs and constraints.  
**Example (Booking Management System):**  
- The system should load search results within 2 seconds.  
- The system should support 500 concurrent users.  
- The system must comply with data privacy regulations.

## Use Case Diagrams

A **Use Case Diagram** illustrates the interactions between users (actors) and the system to achieve specific goals. Benefits include:

- Clear visualization of system functionality  
- Helps identify all user interactions  
- Supports requirement validation  

**Example: Booking Management System Use Case Diagram**

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** define the conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They ensure the software meets the intended requirements.

**Example: Checkout Feature in Booking System**  
- Users must be able to enter payment details securely.  
- Booking confirmation should be sent immediately after payment.  
- Users should be able to view a summary of their booking before confirming.
